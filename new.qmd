## Terms I may use

- TDGM: True data generating model
- DGP: Data generating process, closely related to the TDGM, but with all the wacky additional uncertainty
- Truth: The comparative truth that we are interested in
- Bias: The distance to the comparative truth
- Variance: When not everything is the same
- Estimate: Something that we calculate or guess 
- Estimand: The thing we aim to estimate and guess
- Population: That larger entity without sampling variance
- Sample: The smaller thing with sampling variance
- Incomplete: There exists a more complete version, but we don't have it
- Observed: What we have
- Unobserved: What we would also like to have

## At the start

Let's start with the core:

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# Statistical inference
Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions from **truths**
:::

Truths are boring, but they are convenient. 

- however, for most problems truths require a lot of calculations, tallying or a complete census. 
- therefore, a proxy of the truth is in most cases sufficient 
- An example for such a proxy is a **sample**
- Samples are widely used and have been for a long time<footnote>See [Jelke Bethlehem's CBS discussion paper](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjkyPTCs4L3AhUCuKQKHUpmBvIQFnoECAMQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbs.nl%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fimported%2Fdocuments%2F2009%2F07%2F2009-15-x10-pub.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3BpUW2s_k0MB5yH1o-QGf2) for an overview of the history of sampling within survey statistics</footnote>

## Hebben we wel data nodig?
Leg uit dat zonder data je nog steeds een antwoord kan vormen. 

Maak een brug van data naar informatie en leg uit dat deze informatie juist datgene is wat de brug vormt tussen de waarheid en het antwoord. 

## Confidence intervals
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="70%"}
![](img/7. confidence_intervals.png){width="90%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
Confidence intervals can be hugely informative!

If we sample 100 samples from a population, then a *95% CI* will cover the population value at least 95 out of 100 times. 

- If the coverage <95: bad estimation process with risk of errors and invalid inference
- If the coverage >95: inefficient estimation process, but correct conclusions and valid inference. Lower statistical power.

## The other type of intervals

![](img/8. prediction_intervals.png){width="90%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
Prediction intervals can also be hugely informative!

Prediction intervals are generally wider than confidence intervals

- This is because it covers inherent uncertainty in the data point on top of sampling uncertainty
- Just like CIs, PIs will become more narrow (for locations) where more information is observed (less uncertainty)
- Usually this is at the location of the mean of the predicted values.

**Narrower intervals mean less uncertainty. It does not mean less bias!**

## Case: Spaceshuttle Challenger
<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
![](img/chal.jpg){width=100%}
</div>
<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
```{r failure, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width=4}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(alr4)
set.seed(123)
Challeng %>% 
  filter(fail > 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(temp, fail)) +
  geom_point() +
  #geom_(height = .1, width = .01) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ylim(0, 5) + xlim(35, 85) +

  theme_classic()
```
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
36 years ago, on 28 January 1986, 73 seconds into its flight and at an altitude of 9 miles, the space shuttle Challenger experienced an enormous fireball caused by one of its two booster rockets and broke up. The crew compartment continued its trajectory, reaching an altitude of 12 miles, before falling into the Atlantic. All seven crew members, consisting of five astronauts and two payload specialists, were killed.

## Nothing happened, so we ignored it
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
```{r darkdata, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 4}
set.seed(123)
Challeng %>% 
  ggplot(aes(temp, fail)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ylim(0, 5) + xlim(35, 85) + 
  ylab("Number of distressed O−rings at each launch") +
  xlab("Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit") + 
  theme_classic()

```
</div>
<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
In de besluitvorming om de launch wel door te laten gaan was sprake van dark data.

***Dark data*** is informatie die niet beschikbaar is. 

Deze ontbrekende informatie heeft de potentie om mensen te misleiden. De notie dat wij misleid kunnen worden is belangrijk omdat we daarmee ook moeten aannemen dat kunstmatige intelligentie misleid kan worden. 

<br><br>

**Als je niet alle informatie hebt, dan bestaat altijd de mogelijkheid dat je een foutieve conclusie trekt of een verkeerde beslissing neemt.**

## In Practice
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="30%"}
![](img/9.missingness.png){width=60%}
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

We now have a new problem:

- we do not have the whole truth; but merely a sample of the truth
- we do not even have the whole sample, but merely a sample of the sample of the truth. 

Q4. What would be a simple solution to allowing for valid inferences on the incomplete sample? <br>
Q5. Would that solution work in practice?

:::
::::

## How to fix the missingness problem
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
![](img/11. missingness_solved.png){width=80%}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
There are two sources of uncertainty that we need to cover when analyzing incomplete data:

1. **Uncertainty about the data values we don't have**:<br>when we don't know what the true observed value should be, we must create a distribution of values with proper variance (uncertainty).
2. **Uncertainty about the process that generated the values we do have**:<br>nothing can guarantee that our sample is the one true sample. So it is reasonable to assume that the parameters obtained on our sample are biased. 

A straightforward and intuitive solution for analyzing incomplete data in such scenarios is *multiple imputation* (Rubin, 1987).

## Now how do we know we did well?
::: callout-important
# I'm really sorry!
In practice we don't know if we did well, because we often lack the necessary comparative truths. 
:::

For example:

1. Predict a future response, but we only have the past
2. Analyzing incomplete data without a reference about the truth
3. Estimate the effect between two things that can never occur together
4. Detecting fraudulent transactions with only access to the own transaction history
5. Mixing bonafide observations with bonafide non-observations

# What to do with uncertainty without a truth?

## Scenario 
Let's assume that we have an incomplete data set and that we can impute (fill in) the incomplete values under multiple candidate models

**Challenge**<br>
Imputing this data set under one model may yield different results than imputing this data set under another model. Identify the best model!

**Problem**<br>
We have no idea about validity of either model's results: we would need either the true observed values or the estimand before we can judge the performance and validity of the imputation model.

::: callout-important
# Not all is lost
We do have a constant in our problem: **the observed values**
:::

## Solution
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
![](img/13. PPC_linear.png){width=80%}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
We can *overimpute* the observed values and evaluate how well the models fit on the observed values. 

The assumption would then be that any good imputation model would properly cover the observed data (i.e. would fit to the observed data). 

- If we overimpute the observations multiple times we can calculate bias, intervals and coverage. 
- The model that would be unbiased, properly covered and have the smallest interval width would then be the most efficient model. 

The model to the left clearly does not fit well to the observations.

# When you know you're wrong

## Scenario

In a survey about research integrity and fraud we surveyed behaviours and practices in the following format. 

<center>
![](img/14. not_applicable.png){width=60%}
</center>
<br>
Many behaviours were surveyed over multiple groups of people. Some findings:

- In most groups similar behavioural prevalence was observed. 
- When looking at subgroups, prevalences differ between subgroups.
- Not applicables were much more prevalent in one group than in other groups
- There are too few cases and too many patterns with `Not Applicable`'s over features to allow for a pattern-wise analysis (stratified analysis).
- There are too many `Not Applicables` to allow for *listwise deletion*.

## Some background
We know: 

1. `Not Applicable` is not randomly distributed over the data. Removing them is therefore not valid!
2. `Not Applicable` are bonafide missing values: there should be no observations.

::: callout-important
# There's no such thing as a free lunch

Every imputation will bias the results. For some we know the direction of the bias, for some we have no idea. We do not have access to the truth.
:::

## Now what?
There is no solution to this problem

1. Imputing `Not Applicable` values will have an effect on the inference
2. Not imputing `Not Applicable` leaves us with no inference
3. Ignoring `Not Applicable` leaves us with an unknown effect; we know from missing data theory that it will bias results and lead to invalid inference. 

**Our solution**
We chose to impute the data as `1 (never)`. There are a couple of reasons why we think that this is the best defendable scenario.

1. `Never` has a semantic similarity to a behaviour not being applicable. However,  `Never` implies intentionality; `Not Applicable` does not.
2. We know the effect the imputation has on the inference: Filling in `Never` will underestimate intentional behaviours. 

In this case the choice was made to make a **deliberate error**. The estimates obtained would serve as an underestimation of *true behaviour* and can be considered a lower bound estimation.
